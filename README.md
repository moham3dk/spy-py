# Spy-Py: Surveillance/Spying Python Code

**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISUSE OF THIS CODE**

## Overview

Surveillance/spying app written in Python. I did not have any ill intent when writing this code and I just thought it would be a fun project. Works perfectly on Windows. Works on Mac but is essentially useless without admin privileges. Not tested on Linux, but should work although it will not add to startup (Working on that).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository

2. Install requirements.txt

3. Make a discord webhook that you will put in setup.py

4. Run setup.py as administrator (You can run it without administrator but the program may not work properly)

5. Run main.py as administrator and try it out!
